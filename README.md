## About the [WeatherAPI] (https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=7c2834ec521e574f6dee80fa90a6b6a8)
To use this API the user must get their individual API ID to receive the weather information
To get the key you must create an account, the ID will contain a mixture of 32 letters and numbers
Once you have this ID you will need to put it in the Config.txt file for this program to work

NOTE: the Config file must only contain the ID with no spaces, and on the first line
 
 ## What does this program do?
 This program has been created to test that the user receives the correct information about the weather for their desired location
 With tests for the framework of the site as well as the URL with different endpoints
